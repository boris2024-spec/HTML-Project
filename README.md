<h2>📚 About</h2>
I’m a front-end enthusiast who loves turning bright ideas into accessible, mobile-friendly experiences.<br>
Most of my time is spent experimenting with HTML5, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—then sharing what I learn through open-source contributions. <br>
I enjoy the challenge of responsive design, the elegance of clean code, and the thrill of seeing an interaction feel “just right.” <br>
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me buried in a good book, discovering new music, or planning my next adventure.


The portfolio site highlights Boris Bolmat’s front-end learning journey and side projects.

HTML Projects – static demo pages and landing layouts created to practise semantic markup and responsive design.

JavaScript Projects – small interactive apps (to-do list, tic-tac-toe, memory game, “Matrix” animation, calendar picker, etc.) written in plain Vanilla JS without frameworks.

The goal is to showcase proficiency with HTML 5, CSS 3, and pure JavaScript and to demonstrate the ability to deploy finished work on GitHub Pages.

A simple webpage that showcases basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Highlights
Responsive Layout: Adapts to various screen sizes.
Modern Design: Minimalistic styling with a user-friendly interface.
Interactive Features: Added JavaScript functionalities for enhanced user experience.
